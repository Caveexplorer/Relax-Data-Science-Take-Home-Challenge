# Relax Data Science Take Home Challenge

In this challenge we work with two tables of user data to identify which factors predict future user adoption. An adopted user is defined as one who has logged into the product on three separate days in at least one seven day period.

The columns of the two tables, takehome_users.csv and takehome_user_engagement.csv, are explained in the pdf titled relax_data_science_challenge.pdf.

This challenge is to be treated like a technical data science challenge with limited time. One to two hours is recommended.
